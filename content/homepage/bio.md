Don Hickey is a historian and award-winning author who spent fifty years teaching in higher education. The author of twelve books and more than a hundred articles, he has been called “the dean of 1812 scholarship” by the New Yorker. He is best known for The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict (Bicentennial edition, 2012) and Don’t Give Up the Ship! Myths of the War of 1812 (2006). Don consulted and lectured extensively in the United States, Canada, and the British Isles during the bicentennial of the war.  For promoting public interest in history, Don received the Samuel Eliot Morison Award from the USS Constitution Museum in 2013, and while consulting with the U.S. Post Office during the bicentennial, he was quoted by name in 2015 on the sheet of stamps commemorating the Battle of New Orleans.  

Don's latest book, Tecumseh’s War: The Epic Conflict for the Heart of America, was published by Westholme in the fall of 2023. He is now working on a book on the Quasi-War, America’s undeclared naval war with France in the late 1790s.
