In a major new work, Donald R. Hickey moves Tecumsehâ€™s War to center stage. Instead of treating this conflict as an adjunct of the War of 1812, he gives it the prominence that it deserves in both American and Native American history. A sweeping and engrossing account, this book demonstrates that this was the last time that Native American had a chance of shaping the future of the continent.

In this entertaining and meticulously researched book by America's leading authority on the War of 1812, Donald R. Hickey dispels the many misconceptions that distort our view of America's second war with Great Britain. Embracing military, naval, political, economic, and diplomatic history, Hickey looks carefully at how the war was fought between 1812 and 1815, and how it was remembered thereafter. Who actually won the war, and what was its lasting legacy? Hickey peels away fantasies and embellishments to explore why certain myths gained currency and how they contributed to the way that the United States and Canada view themselves and each other.

Whether or not the United States "won" the war of 1812, the Battle of New Orleans played a central role in shaping how Americans remembered the conflict.  Because this battle involved the larger-than-life frontier hero Andrew Jackson and ended in such a lop-sided British defeat, it contributed as much as anything else to the myth of American victory.   Drawing on a lifetime of research, leading War of 1812 scholar Donald R. Hickey examines Jackson's complex and contradictory character and his remarkable success as a military leader, culminating in what proved to be the defining battle of the War of 1812.
